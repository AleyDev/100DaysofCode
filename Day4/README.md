# 🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors Game ✂️📝

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic hand game played between two players. In this interactive text-based version, you compete against the computer. At each step, you make a choice between rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer does the same. Your goal is to win by selecting the option that beats the computer's choice based on the traditional rules:

✊ Rock beats ✂️ Scissors
✂️ Scissors beats 📄 Paper
📄 Paper beats ✊ Rock
Make the right choices, and you could be the winner! Are you ready to play?

## ⚙️ How to Play

1. When you run the game, you will be prompted to choose between:
   - `0` for ✊ Rock

2. After you make your choice, the computer will randomly pick one of the three options.
