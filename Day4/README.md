# 🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors Game ✂️📝

This is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game implemented in Python. The game allows you to play against the computer by choosing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The game then determines the winner based on the classic rules:

- ✊ Rock beats ✂️ Scissors
- ✂️ Scissors beats 📄 Paper
- 📄 Paper beats ✊ Rock

## ⚙️ How to Play

1. When you run the game, you will be prompted to choose between:
   - `0` for ✊ Rock
   - `1` for 📄 Paper

2. After you make your choice, the computer will randomly pick one of the three options.
3. The game will display the choices of both you and the computer, and announce the winner:
   - If you win, you will see "**You win!** 🎉"
