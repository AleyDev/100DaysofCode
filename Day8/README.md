# 🛡️ Caesar Cipher Tool 🔐  

The **Caesar Cipher Tool** is a Python program that encrypts or decrypts messages using the classic Caesar Cipher technique. Perfect for learning cryptography basics or for fun coding exercises! ✨

## 📋 How It Works  

The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the input message by a specified number of places in the alphabet. Non-alphabet characters (like numbers or symbols) remain unchanged.  

### Encoding  
1. Enter the message to be encrypted.  
2. Provide the shift amount (positive integer).  
3. Each letter is shifted forward in the alphabet by the shift amount.  

### Decoding  
1. Enter the message to be decrypted.  
2. Provide the same shift amount used for encoding.  
3. Each letter is shifted backward in the alphabet by the shift amount.
